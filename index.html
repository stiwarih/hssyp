<p>The epilepsy is most common neurological disorder in which clusters of nerve cells (neurons), in the brain sometimes signal abnormally and cause seizures. Currently it affects 60 million people all over the world. Normal function of neurons is to generate electrical and chemical signals that act on other neurons, in turn cause secondary actions leading to a desired behavior. During a seizure, many neurons try to send signal at the same time, this abnormal surge of excessive electrical activity causes involuntary movements, and may cause a loss of control, lapse of attention or whole-body convulsion.</p>

<p>The introduction of new anti-epileptic drugs has made the most patient control the antiepileptic disorder, still one-third of people with epilepsy continue to have seizures despite treatment. In addition, the nature of the disease is quite unpredictable creates significant anxiety to the patients, mainly due to the fact that patients can experience loss of control and/or awareness. Thus detection and future predictions are key to minimize or eliminate the anxiety and fears at least in the cases where drug has no affect. A device able to detect seizures quickly could also improve patient care.</p>

<p>Seizure detection is usually done using scalp electroencephalogram (EEG), a non-invasive, multichannel recording of the brain’s electrical activity. Classification between a normal activity and a seizure is usually done in two steps: noise filtering and classification. We propose here two approaches to noise filtering. We will use two transforms, Fourier and Discrete wavelets, to filter the data but also extract the useful information and structure behind the signals. We will test classical models of classification and Python’s sklearn libraries to run them.</p>
